# BlobTx Suffix Miner

This Go project performs suffix mining on Ethereum Blob Transactions (EIP-4844). It includes tools to:

1. Fetch and decode transaction fields directly from Ethereum mainnet.
2. Generate transaction data (`tx_data.csv`) from a list of hashes.
3. Reconstruct transaction hashes from transaction data.
4. Find all 16 4-bit suffixes (`0x0` to `0xf`) by incrementing the `GasTipCap` value.

## 📂 Files

### `test2.go`
Fetches full transaction data from Ethereum mainnet using transaction hashes from `selected_hashes.csv`. 

### `test6a.go`
Reads `tx_data.csv`, reconstructs each transaction hash, performs suffix mining by adjusting `GasTipCap`, and writes the results to `suffix_mining_results.csv`.

---

## 🧪 Workflow

### 1. Prepare `selected_hashes.csv`

Create a CSV file with one transaction hash per line:

```

0xabc123...
0xdef456...

````

### 2. Fetch transaction data

Edit `test2.go` and replace:

```go
ethclient.Dial("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<PROJECT_ID>")
````

with your own Infura Project ID.

```go
txHash := common.HexToHash("TX_HASH_HERE")
````
with the tx hash whose details has to be fetched

Then run:

```bash
go run test2.go
```

Use the data to update `tx_data.csv` with all required transaction fields.

### 3. Run the suffix mining algorithm

Once `tx_data.csv` is ready, execute:

```bash
go run test6a.go
```

This will:

* Verify the original transaction hash.
* Mine hashes with suffixes from `0x0` to `0xf` by incrementing `GasTipCap`.
* Output the result in `suffix_mining_results.csv`.

---

## 📁 Input/Output Files

* `selected_hashes.csv` — list of target transaction hashes (input).
* `tx_data.csv` — full transaction field dump for suffix mining (generated by `test2.go`).
* `suffix_mining_results.csv` — final output containing all 16 suffixes and timing data (generated by `test6a.go`).

---

## 📤 Output Format

`suffix_mining_results.csv` has the following structure:

```
original_hash, 0, 1, 2, ..., f, time_microseconds
```

* `original_hash`: The expected hash from `tx_data.csv`.
* `0` through `f`: Transaction hashes ending in each 4-bit suffix.
* `time_microseconds`: Time taken to find all 16 suffixes.
